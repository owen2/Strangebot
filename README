Dr.Strangebot An AI Agent for DEFCON
by Owen Johnson
owen@owenjohnson.info

This is an AI agent to play the commercial game DEFCON, a nuclear warfare simulation. Included is a world information library I made (feel free to steal it for your own bot) and a luabot skelleton file I made (also feel free to steal). The agent was created to research realtime decision making, partially observable worlds, and stochastic actions.

You need to rename the folder these files are in to `strangebot` and place it in the AI folder of defcon. Then load the bot enabled version of the game to load it as a player.
